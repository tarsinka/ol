These are AIGER benchmarks obtained with 'smv2qbf' from the
SMV models in the Tip-Suite.  These are structural SAT problems
for k-induction.  Each SMV model is encoded for one induction
depth with 5 different AIG simplifiers as described in:

  R. Brummayer, A. Biere. Local Two-Level And-Inverter Graph Minimization
  without Blowup. In Proc. 2nd Doctoral Workshop on Mathematical and
  Engineering Methods in Computer Science (MEMICS'06), Mikulov, Czechia,
  October 2006.

Note the size of the AIGs is slightly different from the sizes reported in
the paper since the tools and the format has changed slightly.
